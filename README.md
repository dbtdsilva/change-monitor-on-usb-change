# Swiss Windows Knife

### What is it?
A Swiss Windows Knife, kinda like a Swiss Army Knife but for Windows. 
Let's be honest, it's my personal army knife for my Windows machines.

It does a bit of everything and nothing, here goes some:
- automatically swap between monitors inputs (eg. from HDMI to DP) when a new mouse / keyboard is connected or disconnected;
- changes brightness and contrast of monitors according to the monitors;
- and much more..

### Generate the installer
The installer will be located under build/installer/SwissWindowsKnife-<version>.exe by using:
```sh
python setup installer
```
Alternatively, you can also check the releases on GitHub.
